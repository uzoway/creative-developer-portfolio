## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- GSAP

### Approach

- This was pretty straightforward. I started by creating a function ***initializeGsapAnimation()*** which gets called when the window DOM is loaded. The function contains the gsap timeline and tweens. 
- In the function, I created a gsap timeline ***heroTl*** with some defaults(ease and duration) to reduce the amount of code. Then I tied all tweens to the heroTL timeline.
- To replicate the timing from the original motion design, I used the gsap position parameter ***"<"*** to make sure all tween starts at the same time. This helped me get the animation as close as possible.
